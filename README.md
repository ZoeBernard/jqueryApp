# jqueryApp

A Jquery test app, to try and work with some basic Jquery.
The app shows three recipes on the main screen, which are shown with the use of HTML, CSS and a little bit of Jquery.
When a button is pushed, the user will be redirected to a more detailed recipe screen.

The Jquery commands that are used:
- .append()	      Adds an element to the HTML body
- .remove()	      Deletes element from the HTML body
- .animate()	    Animates the screen
- .scrollTop()	  Sets the coordinates for the scroll bar
- .click()	      OnClick - a function is called (both on buttons and text)
- .ready()	      Everything is run AFTER the DOM is loaded
- .insertAfter()	Inserts element after the set element
- .css()		      To get color - and set color
